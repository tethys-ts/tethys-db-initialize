properties:
  feature:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The hydrologic feature associated with the dataset.'
  parameter:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The recorded observation parameter.'
  method:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The way the recorded observation was obtained.'
  processing_code:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The code associated with the processing state of the recorded observation.'
  owner:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The operator, owner, and/or producer of the associated data.'
  aggregation_statistic:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The statistic that defines how the result was calculated. The aggregation statistic is calculated over the time frequency interval associated with the recorded observation.'
  frequency_interval:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The frequency that the observation was recorded at. In the form 1H for hourly.'
  utc_offset:
    bsonType: 'string'
    description: 'The offset time from UTC associated with the frequency_interval. For example, if data was collected daily at 9:00, then the frequency_interval would be 24H and the utc_offset would be 9H. The offset must be smaller than the frequency_interval.'
