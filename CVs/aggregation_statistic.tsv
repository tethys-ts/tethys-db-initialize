name	definition
mean	The values represent the mean over a time interval, such as daily mean discharge or daily mean temperature.
categorical	The values are categorical rather than continuous valued quantities.
confidence_interval	In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate of a statistical parameter. It is an observed interval (i.e., it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the value of an unobservable parameter of interest if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient.
constant_over_interval	The values are quantities that can be interpreted as constant for all time, or over the time interval to a subsequent measurement of the same variable at the same site.
cumulative	The values represent the cumulative value of a variable measured or calculated up to a given instant of time, such as cumulative volume of flow or cumulative precipitation.
incremental	The values represent the incremental value of a variable over a time interval, such as the incremental volume of flow or incremental precipitation.
maximum	The values are the maximum values occurring at some time during a time interval, such as annual maximum discharge or a daily maximum air temperature.
median	The values represent the median over a time interval, such as daily median discharge or daily median temperature.
minimum	The values are the minimum values occurring at some time during a time interval, such as 7-day low flow for a year or the daily minimum temperature.
mode	The values are the most frequent values occurring at some time during a time interval, such as annual most frequent wind direction.
standard_deviation	The values represent the standard deviation of a set of observations made over a time interval. Standard deviation computed using the unbiased formula SQRT(SUM((Xi-mean)^2)/(n-1)) are preferred. The specific formula used to compute variance can be noted in the methods description.
standard_error_of_the_mean	The standard error of the mean (SEM) quantifies the precision of the mean. It is a measure of how far your sample mean is likely to be from the true population mean. It is expressed in the same units as the data.
unknown	The aggregation statistic is unknown.
variance	The values represent the variance of a set of observations made over a time interval. Variance computed using the unbiased formula SUM((Xi-mean)^2)/(n-1) are preferred. The specific formula used to compute variance can be noted in the methods description.
instantaneous	The values are meant to represent measurements at a particular instant in time. In practice, few measurements are actually representative of an instantaneous point in time, but rather are implied to be roughly that time.
