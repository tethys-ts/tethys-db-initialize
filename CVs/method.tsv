name	definition
derivation	A method for creating results by simple calculations from field activities, sample analyses, or sensor recordings.
estimation	A method for creating results by rough approximation or professional judgement. This implies that it does not use an analytical or numerical model.
field_activity	A method for creating results by performing an activity in the field at or on a sampling feature.
simulation	A method for creating results by running an analytical or numerical model. This is generally more complex and/or more uncertain than derivations.
sample_analysis	A method for ex situ analysis of a sample using an instrument, typically in a laboratory, for the purpose of measuring properties of a sample.
sensor_recording	A method for creating results by automatic sensor measurements.
forecast	A type of simulation to predict the future.
